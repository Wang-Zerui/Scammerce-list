## Scammerce S.O.P
  1. If there **direct evidence** alredy: [get the scammer approved](#approving-the-un-innocence-is-that-even-a-word-of-scammers), [then do whatever you want with the scammer](#things-to-do-with-scammers).
  2. If there isnt already direct evidence, you can engage in conversation untill there is direct evidence, then [get the scammer approved](#approving-the-un-innocence-is-that-even-a-word-of-scammers). After that, you are free to do [whatever you want with the scammer](#things-to-do-with-scammers).

## Things to do with scammers:
  - Seduction: 
    - It is a very useful tool to get the real life identiities to call the cops on them
    - also very fun! (10/10, will do again)
  - Getting to meet in a (preferably hard to get to) place and then deserting the scammer. (seduction might help)
  - Meeting up with a scammer and calling the cops (bravery and self-defense required, especially with pedos)
  - If there is a group chat of victims, you can inform all the victims that they have been scammed, and then spam the scammers about it.
  - [SPAM THEM MUAHAHAHAHHAHA](#spam)

## Spam:
*(note: be wary of these strategies especially on heavily policed platforms such as Whatsapp as this can get you banned)*  
  - Whatsapp signups (calling is preferred because it is more disruptive)
  - Large videos (there is a stack of 102 67MB videos which makes 6.8GB in total), for use on Whatsapp. PM wa.me/6584801926 (Estelle) or ask for it in Scammerce - General chat if you want it.
  - Large images (there is a 2MB image file) for use on Whatsapp. PM wa.me/6584801926 (Estelle) if you want it.
  - Newsletter spam (Try searching for them online yourself hehe)
  - Non-animated stickers on Whatsapp (no way to avoid downloading these, but maximum is 1MB per sticker, so use an autoclicker)
  - Late night calls (just do this if you happen to be awake at midnight)
  - Spam **VERY LOUD** earrape tracks (google.com).
  - Spam porn

## Approving the un-innocence (is that even a word?) of scammers:
Send screenshots (and other evidence, if you have) to the [scam report group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/ISqqbyKNUl7JIW8nrG3UJ0)

## Malicious sites:
  - Gmaul.com
  - Oitlook.com
  - Aerospacengineering.net

## Useful tools:
### IP logger:
  1. Go to grabify.link
  2. Enter the url (preferably a malicious site from Scammerce but can be any malicious websites) (refer to Malicious Sites)
  3. Use a custom domain name and it's now up to your skills at social engineering.
### Alt phone number from USA:
  1. Download TextNow, Talkatone or SecondLine.
  2. Register for an account.
  3. Get a second copy of Whatsapp either on a virtual machine or dual messenger.
  4. Sign up for Whatsapp via calling and talk in normal conversations for at least two weeks before starting to conduct operations on the new number.

### Tips:
  - reply to the scammer to get more scams!
  - you can organise an event for most of the chat to go spam a group chat
  - if they ask for documents, the Scammerce-general chat can help you out
  - if they ask you to go to a website and you want to waste their time,
    - inspect element and delete the \<body\> tag to make the page blank
    - or zoom into a part of the page that is completely one color to make it seem blank  
    and then, you can say that your router had anti-scammer protection and say that you are uninstalling, and meep it at that for as long as you like
