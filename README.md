  3. Attempt to get the scammer to open IP logger links (refer to Useful Tools > IP logger)
  4. When the scammer finds out, either try to convince him again that you can be trusted

  4. When the scammer finds out, spam. (refer to Spam)
### Fake investment groups:  
#### (if a link was received) 
  1. Send the link to Scammerce and call for the creation of a new task force.
  2. Other people shall join the group gradually.
  3. Two people gain trust with the admins while initiating spam by the other members both within the group and directly to the admins. (refer to Spam)

#### (if you were added directly)
  1. Send a screenshot of the admins to Scammerce - General and call for the creation of a new task force.
  2. Check whether admins are online.
  3. If admins are online, stay low and attempt to get the invite link. Once invite link is obtained, follow the steps in the previous section.
  4. If admins are offline, spam the group. (refer to Spam)
## Spam:
*(note: be wary of these strategies especially on heavily policed platforms such as Whatsapp as this can get you banned)*  
  - Whatsapp signups (calling is preferred because it is more disruptive)
  - Large videos (there is a stack of 102 67MB videos which makes 6.8GB in total), for use on Whatsapp. PM wa.me/6584801926 (Estelle) or ask for it in Scammerce - General chat if you want it.
  - Large images (there is a 2MB image file) for use on Whatsapp. PM wa.me/6584801926 (Estelle) if you want it.
  - Newsletter spam (Try searching for them online yourself)
  - Non-animated stickers on Whatsapp (no way to avoid downloading these, but maximum is 1MB per sticker, so use autoclicker)
  - Late night calls (just do this if you happen to be awake at midnight)
## Useful tools:
### IP logger:
  1. Go to grabify.link or iplogger.org
  2. Enter the url (preferably a malicious site from Scammerce but can be any malicious websites) (refer to Malicious Sites)
